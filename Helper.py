# Logistic Regression with sklearn
## 2020 State Presidential Vote vs. Mask Use vs. Vaccination Rates
Logistic Regression is a classifcation algorithm used to
classify two or more classes.

** About the Data: **
In order to show how to implement Logistic Regression using sklearn, lets take
a look at a simple data set about 2020 mask use and COVID vaccination rates in America by state.
- STNAME: Name of the State
- FREQ/ALWAYS: porportion of people reported to wear a mask frequently or always
- FULLY_VACCINATED: porportion of people fully vaccinated in the states
- PARTY: State voted Democratic or Republican in 2020 (1: Republican, 0: Democrat)

# Conclusion
Using Logistic Regression we were able to predict with 100% accuracy which states
voted Republican or Democratic in the 2020 election based on their
mask use and vaccine rates.

** Note: **
Due to the very small amount of data, this is not a necessarily a useful result.
Our training set had 43 samples while our test had 8 samples.
The more difficult / insightful problem to solve would be predicting by county or city.
